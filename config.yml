    description: "Hi! I am a social data scientist/computational social scientist/quantitative researcher. For the past few years, I've been supporting public safety analytics at the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance by building data pipelines and applying statistical/ML models to understand policing. <br><br> I'm currently looking for opportunities to make an impact in climate tech and ways to engage in environmental/sustainability efforts at any level. <br> Outside of work, youâ€™ll almost certainly find me on a tennis court, with my nose in a good book, or painting!"
